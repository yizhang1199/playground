 *
 * Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster for the school.
 *
 * In the end, you should be able to:
 *
 * Add a student's name to the roster for a grade
 * "Add Jim to grade 2."
 * "OK."
 * Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade
 * "Which students are in grade 2?"
 * "We've only got Jim just now."
 * Get a sorted list of all students in all grades. Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.
 * "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"
 * "Grade 1: Anna, Barb, and Charlie. Grade 2: Alex, Peter, and Zoe. Grade 3â€¦"
 *
 * Note that all our students only have one name. (It's a small town, what do you want?)
