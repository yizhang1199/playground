/**
 * Always use def, not val, in a trait for abstract members.  Even if val in the trait defines a function expression,
 * can't use def to define the function - see Example below.
 *
 * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19642053/when-to-use-val-or-def-in-scala-traits
 * A def can be implemented by a def, a val, a lazy val or an object. So it's the most abstract form of defining a member.
 * Since traits are usually abstract interfaces, saying you want a val is saying how the implementation should do.
 *
 * https://blog.jessitron.com/2012/07/10/choices-with-def-and-val-in-scala/
 * In a subclass, you can override a def with a val or a def, but you can only override a val with a val.
 * When Scala has a val, it knows the value of that expression will never change. This is not true with def;
 * therefore declaring something as val says more than declaring a def.

/**
 * Function Vs Method
 *
 * def defines a method that needs to be included within a trait, class or object.  It corresponds to a
 * Java method in a class/interface.
 * val defines a function, which gets compiled to an instance of an [anonymous] class that implements one
 * of the Function0 through Function22 traits. Scala will create 1 anonymous class and instantiate 1 object
 * from the anonymous class per val function, even if the same function expression is used for multiple vals.
 * (This behavior applies to lambda expressions as well -- see link 1 below)
 *
 * Partial functions: Scala compiler adds an additional method for PartialFunctions.  Example:
 *
 * val second: PartialFunction[List[Int],Int] = {
 *   case x :: y :: _ => y
 * }
 * The above is translated by compiler to:
 * new PartialFunction[List[Int], Int] {
 *   def apply(xs: List[Int]) = xs match {
 *     case x :: y :: _ => y
 *   }
 *   def isDefinedAt(xs: List[Int]) = xs match {
 *     case x :: y :: _ => true
 *     case _ => false
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * Java vs Scala
 * Java creates a private static method in the same class for each Java lambda expression and uses
 * "invokedynamic" to invoke the lambda expression at runtime, which is more performant, because
 * "invokedynmaic" allows the JVM to invoke lambda expressions without having to allocate a wrapper
 * object or invoke a virtual override method
 *
 * Scala functions will be invoked using "invokevirtual" by the JVM.  Scala functions are implemented using pure OO and
 * therefore incurs more performance overhead due to the additional wrapper class and object as well as invoking a
 * virtual override method (aka virtual function dispatches via vtable)
